# LibreDraw
Drawing software for homemade GRBL based drawing robots. 

This is a side project that I add to as I play with my drawing robot.
You can build your own drawing robot using 3D printed parts and the numerous online guides.
My robot is based on the design found here:

I eventually hope to create a minimal interface to control GRBL based drawing robots.
